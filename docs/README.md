## Getting Started with Architecture

### 1. Understanding the Core Components

Start with the [main architecture document](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand:
- System overview and component relationships
- High-level data flow
- Core architectural patterns

### 2. Database and Data Design

Review the [database architecture](DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for:
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Data access patterns
- Performance optimization strategies

### 3. Extending Functionality

Explore the [runtime architecture](RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md) to learn:
- Plugin development patterns
- Hook system usage
- Runtime environment details

### 4. Client Integration

Study the [API architecture](API_ARCHITECTURE.md) for:
- API endpoint documentation
- Request/response patterns
- Real-time communication flows

### 5. Production Deployment

Reference the [deployment architecture](DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for:
- Infrastructure patterns
- Scaling strategies
- Security considerations

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Modularity
```mermaid

    A[Modular Design] --> B[Clear Separation of Concerns]
    A --> C[Pluggable Components]
    A --> D[Independent Scaling]
```

### 2. Scalability
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Horizontal Scaling] --> B[Stateless Services]
    A --> C[Load Balancing]
    A --> D[Database Sharding]
```

### 3. Extensibility
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Runtime Hooks] --> B[Custom Logic]
    A --> C[Multi-language Support]
    A --> D[Plugin Architecture]
```

### 4. Performance
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Performance] --> B[Caching Layers]
    A --> C[Connection Pooling]
    A --> D[Async Processing]
```

## Common Architecture Patterns

### 1. Request Flow Pattern
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant API as API Layer
    participant RT as Runtime
    participant DB as Database

    C->>API: Request
    API->>RT: Before Hook
    RT-->>API: Continue
    API->>DB: Data Operation
    DB-->>API: Response
    API->>RT: After Hook
    RT-->>API: Final Response
    API-->>C: Response
```

### 2. Event-Driven Pattern
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Event Trigger] --> B[Event Queue]
    B --> C[Event Handler]
    C --> D[Side Effects]
```

### 3. Plugin Pattern
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Core System] --> B[Plugin Interface]
    B --> C[Lua Plugin]
    B --> D[JavaScript Plugin]
    B --> E[Go Plugin]
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput Metrics
- **HTTP API**: 10,000+ requests/second per node
- **WebSocket**: 10,000+ concurrent connections per node
- **Database**: Optimized for high read/write ratios
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient pooling and garbage collection

### Latency Targets
- **API Response**: < 10ms (95th percentile)
- **Database Queries**: < 5ms (average)
- **Cache Access**: < 1ms (average)
- **Real-time Messages**: < 50ms end-to-end

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Auth
    participant External

    Client->>API: Auth Request
    API->>External: Validate (if social)
    External-->>API: Valid
    API->>Auth: Generate Session
    Auth-->>API: Session Token
    API-->>Client: Authenticated
```

### Authorization Model
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[User] --> B[Session Token]
    B --> C[Permissions]
    C --> D[Resource Access]
    D --> E[Data Operation]
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application Metrics] --> D[Metrics Store]
    B[Infrastructure Metrics] --> D
    C[Business Metrics] --> D
    D --> E[Dashboards]
    D --> F[Alerts]
```

### Health Checks
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Health Check Endpoint] --> B[Database Health]
    A --> C[Cache Health]
    A --> D[Runtime Health]
    A --> E[External Service Health]
```
